# yahtzee
Play a game of Yahtzee!

I made this as a small project and got it reasonably nice and polished.
Theres not really any algorithmically difficult stuff, but it was a good experience in clean code that I could debug easily

Anyway, just run ```python3 yahtzee.py``` and have fun.

The 'help' command will be useful.

Maximum of four players, batteries not included
